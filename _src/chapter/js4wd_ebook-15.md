**Mat “Wilto” Marquis** makes websites for a living, and curses at his broken-down motorcycle for free, on the streets of north Cambridge. He is the chair of the Responsive Issues Community Group, a technical editor at *A List Apart*, a former member of the jQuery team, and an editor of the HTML5 specification. Of all these things, Mat is most proud of having finished *Mega Man 2*—on “difficult”—without losing a single life.
