Thanks to everyone who told me that writing this book was a terrific idea, starting with Kristina Halvorson, who said it first. Thanks also to Dan Tyre, Richard Waystack, Hannah Fleishman, Danielle Kowalski, Scott Kubie, and Jami Oetting, who either encouraged me at the outset or egged me on every step of the way. Sarah Winters and Aaron Burgess both reviewed an early manuscript of this book and gave me valuable feedback and love, for which I am grateful beyond words. Ann Handley took me out for dinner and reassured me that I wasn’t alone in my lifelong love for newsletters and what they can do.

Thanks to Christopher O’Donnell, Josh Porter, Tim Merrill, and Libby Maurer, who supported and sponsored the growth of content design at HubSpot before many product people even knew what it was. Thanks to Brian Halligan, who didn’t blink when I cornered him in a hallway in 2010 and told him HubSpot needed an internal newsletter, said that sounded fantastic, and let me take it from there. Thanks to everyone at HubSpot who has loved, read, and submitted to the WIN. Writing this newsletter and serving as an amplifier for the unique personality and verve of this remarkable company has always been the best part of my job. Thank you for letting me hold up a mirror to you every week and remind you what excellent people you are.
