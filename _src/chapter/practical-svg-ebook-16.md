Special thanks to Lea Verou, who was writing about SVG before it got cool again and who introduced me to Chris Lilley—whom I can thank not only for tech editing this book but, more importantly, for ushering SVG into fruition in the first place.

Thanks to Sara Soueidan who has been tirelessly advocating SVG to front-end developers and helping them see the light.

Thanks to Katel LeDû for shepherding this book’s creation and to Caren Litherland for keeping my foot out of my mouth and making sure my sentences done read more gooder (sorry). Thanks to the other authors and everyone involved at A Book Apart, the existence of which inspires me. I feel honored to be a part of it.

I’d like to shout out to Fabrice Weinberg, who created the original svgstore Grunt plugin based on an idea I had to automate an SVG icon system. I hopped on that right away and haven’t looked back.

Props to the team at Noun Project who have been curating the world’s greatest source of SVG iconography. They bet on SVG early on and I’m very glad they did.
