I’ve sprinkled links to resources through this book, and I hope you’ve followed them as they’ve cropped up. This section lists documentation, texts, sites, and tools that I find particularly valuable, but that I didn’t explicitly cover in the book or explore in detail. Many of these resources have interactive elements—the web is perfect for that; books, not so much. Be sure to check out these gems:

* **“SVG,”** Mozilla Developer Network. This is a directory page that links to hundreds of individual pages covering every SVG element, attribute, DOM interface, effect, and much more. It is likely the most comprehensive resource on SVG ([http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-01/](http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-01/)).
* **“A Complete Guide to SVG Fallbacks,”** Amelia Bellamy-Royds. This covers every possible scenario of SVG usage and browsers that don’t support it ([http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-02/](http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-02/)).
* **“SVG on the Web – A Practical Guide,”** Jake Giltsoff. A long-form, open-source reference guide that lists quite a few resources as well ([svgontheweb.com](https://svgontheweb.com/)).
* **“Inline SVG vs Icon Fonts \[CAGEMATCH\],”** by me. My complete, point-by-point analysis compares the two most popular techniques for icon systems ([http://bkaprt.com/psvg/03-06/](http://bkaprt.com/psvg/03-06/)).
* **“Ten Reasons We Switched from an Icon Font to SVG,”** Ian Feather. Ian’s rationale for moving to an SVG icon system on Lonely Planet influenced my own thinking ([http://bkaprt.com/psvg/04-06/](http://bkaprt.com/psvg/04-06/)).
* **“Use SVG for Icons,”** Pete LePage. If you aren’t convinced by lone developers’ opinions, perhaps you’ll like the official advice from Google ([http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-03/](http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-03/)).
* **IcoMoon:** An interactive tool for building SVG sprites for use as an icon system. One of the longest-running and best tools for the job ([http://bkaprt.com/psvg/04-01/](http://bkaprt.com/psvg/04-01/)).
* **Grunticon:** Perhaps the most popular SVG-based icon system tool, Grunticon generates a conditionally-loaded CSS file where each icon is converted into a class that applies a data URL `background-image` of that icon ([http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-04/](http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-04/)).
* **grunt-svgstore:** Fabrice Weinburg’s grunt plugin combines multiple SVG files into a single sprite. I dreamed up the idea for a tool like this; Weinburg built what I believe is the first of its kind ([http://bkaprt.com/psvg/04-03/](http://bkaprt.com/psvg/04-03/)).
* **gulp-svg-sprite:** The Gulp equivalent of Weinburg’s plugin, by Joschi Kuphal ([http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-05/](http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-05/)).
* **“Understanding SVG Coordinate Systems and Transformations,”** Sara Soueidan. Sara has done lots of SVG evangelism. This article is among many of hers that plumb one aspect of SVG deeply; it includes an interactive exploration tool ([http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-06/](http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-06/)).
* **Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)** **1.1****:** This is the official specification for SVG by the W3C ([http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-07/](http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-07/)).
* Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) 2. Like any good new specification, this draft specification for the upcoming version of SVG “adds new features commonly requested by authors.” I know I’m excited for things like wrapping text ([http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-08/](http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-08/)).
* **“Bespoke SVG Reference,”** Chris Nager. The discovery that `path` is the ultimate SVG shape element—all shapes are ultimately drawn with it—was a real eye-opener for me. The `path` syntax may look a bit strange, but Nager breaks down how simple it actually is ([http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-09/](http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-09/)).
* **SVGeneration:** This interactive tool does a wonderful job of showing off interesting SVG design possibilities generated from very little code ([svgeneration.com](http://www.svgeneration.com/)).
* **SVG Fancy Town:** This is my personal collection of SVG demos that I find particularly impressive ([http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-10/](http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-10/)).
* **“The Image That Called Me,”** Mario Heiderich. This is probably the most widely cited text regarding SVG and security. A lot of the danger boils down to the fact that SVG is XML-based and can contain JavaScript, which makes it an XSS concern ([http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-11/](http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-11/), PDF).
* **“Tips for Creating Accessible SVG,”** Léonie Watson. A classic article on how to structure SVG to be accessible ([http://bkaprt.com/psvg/09-07/](http://bkaprt.com/psvg/09-07/)).
* **Can I Use…:** This is the most popular site for tracking browser support of browser features, including SVG. Admirably, the site doesn’t track SVG as a blanket “yes or no” in terms of support, but looks at individual SVG features and partial support levels of those features ([http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-12/](http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-12/)).
* **“You Don't Know SVG,”** Dmitry Baranovskiy. A video of a talk bursting with SVG possibilities ([http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-13/](http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-13/)).
* **SVG** **Weirdness:** This GitHub repo organized by Emil Björklund tracks unexpected cross-browser bugs in SVG ([http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-14/](http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-14/)).
* **Chromium Bug Tracker:** A collection of SVG bugs reported to the Chromium project ([http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-15/](http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-15/)).
* **Bugzilla:** A collection of SVG bugs reported to the Mozilla project ([http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-16/](http://bkaprt.com/psvg/11-16/)).
