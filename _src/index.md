This thing is pretty old.

Now, the good news is that the ongoing development of JavaScript, as a language, involves taking great pains (deliberate word choice, there) to ensure that new features don’t break features already rolled out to the web platform. This means that even though this book may not represent the most modern approaches to JavaScript development, the gritty details will still be accurate. Should you be using `var` at this point? Almost certainly not—but it _is_ still part of the platform, and if you should ever find yourself working with it, it works the way you’ll learn in this book.

If you’re looking for something a little newer, the [JavaScript course I wrote for the Chrome team’s web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/javascript/) is a great place to start, if I may say so myself.
