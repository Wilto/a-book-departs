This thing is pretty old now. The good news is that the ongoing development of JavaScript, as a language, involves taking great pains to prevent any features already rolled out to the web from breaking—anything already rolled out to the web platform is very unlikely to *change*. What that means is that, while this book doesn’t cover the most *modern* approaches to JavaScript development, the information it contains is still accurate, even despite all the features added to the language in the years since this book was first published.

If you’re looking to learn about the latest JavaScript has to offer, I wrote <https://web.dev/learn/javascript> much more recently.
