Our original publisher, A Book Apart, has shut down—but you can now get a print or ebook copy of *Design for Real Life* republished by Eric and Sara. Here's where to buy: 

* USA: Bookshop.org, Barnes & Noble, Walmart.com
* Canada: Chapters / Indigo 
* Sweden: Adlibris

You can also find the book on Amazon in many countries, but we recommend an independent seller where possible.

This edition of *Design for Real Life* is the same as the original from A Book Apart, with only slight design modifications to remove the old branding.
