# A Book Depart

### First…

`npm install`

## Then…

### Extract the Book Contents

Drop your .epub into the `./epub` directory and run `npm run extract`. 

Thanks to Jeff Eaton’s 「[DANCING QUEEN](https://github.com/eaton/dq)」, the contents of the .epub will get turned into Markdown and dropped into `_src/chapter` alongside all your images, while a `_data/meta.json` will be created with basic information—book title, your name, copyright information, ISBN, former publisher, and cover color. `_data/` will also contain JSON files with lists of all the extracted files, links in the copy, and the table of contents.

## And finally…

### Build the Dev Site

`npm start`

### Build the Production Site

`npm run production` or just `eleventy`

## Known Issues
Some maniacs (cough) used bold and italics in their code snippets. Unfortunately, the markup responsible for that formatting is going to come through as Markdown, which won’t be _interpreted_ as Markdown on account of being inside codeblocks. Those will have to be cleaned out manually.
